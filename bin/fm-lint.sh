#!/usr/bin/env bash
# fm-lint.sh - the single owner of firstmate's lint definition.
#
# Runs its file set with ShellCheck's default severity, extended analysis,
# ambient configuration disabled, and one exact ShellCheck version. CI and
# no-mistakes both invoke this script with no arguments, so the rule set,
# version, bounded execution, and diagnostics ordering cannot drift.
# The explicit --fast mode is local-only and disables ShellCheck's extended
# dataflow analysis while preserving ordinary shell lint checks. CI and
# no-mistakes keep the full-analysis no-argument default.
# Tests stop source analysis at imported production modules because every
# production shell is already a canonical, source-aware root of this same run.
# The default (no explicit-path) path also runs bin/fm-lint-workflows.sh so a
# malformed GitHub workflow, including a self-broken ci.yml, fails locally
# before merge instead of only failing to run as CI.
#
# With no explicit paths, the file set depends on context:
#   - In CI (GITHUB_ACTIONS=true or CI=true), on the main branch, or when no
#     merge-base against origin/main (or local main) can be found, it lints
#     the full canonical set: bin/*.sh bin/backends/*.sh tests/*.sh. This is
#     what CI always runs, so CI coverage never depends on a local diff.
#   - Otherwise (an ordinary local branch with a real merge-base) it lints
#     only the canonical-set files changed since that merge-base, including
#     uncommitted local edits, via plain local `git diff` (no network, no
#     `gh`). A branch with zero matching changed files skips ShellCheck and
#     prints a "no changed lint targets" note, then still validates workflows.
# Explicit paths always bypass this file-set selection and lint exactly the
# given paths, matching the same config, without the workflow YAML check.
# Explicit core bin/ and bin/backends/ scripts still receive the
# backend-purity check. It rejects direct Beads CLI invocations so every
# configured backlog backend follows the same tasks-axi lifecycle path.
#
# Execution is memory-bounded, not throughput-bounded: exactly one ShellCheck
# process at a time, and exactly one root file per invocation (FM_LINT_BATCH_SIZE).
#
# What actually costs memory here is one root's INLINED PROGRAM - the root plus
# everything --external-sources pulls in transitively - under extended dataflow
# analysis, and it grows far faster than that program's size. Measured on this
# tree with ShellCheck 0.11.0 on 2026-09-09:
#   bin/fm-spawn.sh      690 KB inlined   3.43 GB peak (242 MB with dataflow off)
#   bin/fm-teardown.sh   790 KB inlined  >6.5 GB peak (684 MB with dataflow off)
#   77 small roots       964 KB total     197 MB peak in ONE invocation
# The last row is why batching is not itself the accumulator: ShellCheck frees
# between roots, so a batch peaks at its worst root, not at their sum. The
# 2026-09-09 host exhaustion at 7.6 GB was two CONCURRENT shards each carrying
# one of those large roots at the same time.
#
# So the serial pipeline is what removes the multiplier that crashed the host,
# and one root per invocation is what makes the remaining peak attributable to a
# single named root instead of to whichever roots a scheduler happened to pair.
# That is why the batch size must stay 1 rather than being traded back for
# process startup.
#
# --external-sources is therefore not a blanket default. A root gets it only
# when it needs source resolution to be judged correctly, decided per file by
# fm_lint_needs_source_analysis below. Roots that source nothing are proven to
# produce byte-identical diagnostics either way, so the verdict is unchanged.
#
# One root per invocation is still not a bound, because a single root can be too
# large on its own. FM_LINT_MAX_CLOSURE_KB is that bound: a root whose inlined
# program exceeds it is analyzed WITHOUT source traversal, and the run says so on
# one labelled line naming the root, its closure size, and what was excluded for
# it. Such a root keeps every ordinary shell check and loses cross-module
# dataflow. FM_LINT_BOUNDED_EXCLUDES lists what cannot fairly be reported against
# it: SC1091 for the sources this runner declined to load, and SC2034 and SC2329
# for a variable or function whose only consumer lives in one of them. Those are
# boundaries this runner drew, not defects in the root. Both constants are used
# identically in CI and locally, so the verdict cannot diverge between them.
#
# 320 KB is derived from measurement on this tree, as the point where the full
# path crosses about 1 GB: 313 KB -> 0.98 GB, 321 KB -> 1.03 GB, 327 KB -> 1.20 GB.
# It leaves 25 of 377 roots on the bounded path. Closure size is a good but not
# perfect predictor - 354 KB -> 0.81 GB and 395 KB -> 1.05 GB are low outliers -
# so treat the limit as calibrated, not exact, and re-derive it from fresh
# measurements rather than nudging it to make one root fit.
#
# The worker writes one diagnostics stream in deterministic root order and the
# parent replays it after the worker finishes. FM_LINT_JOBS / --jobs is still
# accepted and still validated as 1 or 2, but it no longer selects concurrency:
# both values run the same single serial pipeline with byte-identical
# diagnostics and exit selection.
#
# Optional quiet telemetry writes one bounded TSV snapshot of content and source
# graph identity, wall/CPU/RSS, batch bounds, and competing ShellCheck processes.
#
# Usage:
#   fm-lint.sh                         lint the context-selected file set (see above)
#   fm-lint.sh --fast [path]...       local lint with extended analysis disabled
#   fm-lint.sh <path>...               lint explicit roots with the same config
#   fm-lint.sh --jobs <1|2> [path]...  accepted for compatibility; always serial
#   fm-lint.sh --telemetry <path> ...  write a quiet metrics snapshot
#   fm-lint.sh --required-version      print the ShellCheck pin
#   fm-lint.sh --closure-limit-kb      print the source-closure limit in KB
#   fm-lint.sh --list-files            print the file set that would be linted
#   fm-lint.sh --help                  print this usage

# fm-lint.sh is routinely invoked by tooling from a non-interactive shell with

# Without isolation, it inherits whatever ambient process group its caller
# happens to share with other processes, so that caller's own unrelated
# cleanup (a process-group-wide signal to reap stray background jobs after
# its own command finishes) can kill this script outright before it ever
# prints its real verdict. Re-exec once through Perl so this script always owns
# its process group, the same isolation already given to each ShellCheck worker
# below. A launcher may already have made this process its group leader; that is
# the requested end state, whereas trying setpgrp again fails with EPERM on
# Linux. Every other entry must successfully create and verify its own group.
# FM_LINT_ISOLATED is also set by fm_lint_run_worker for the private
